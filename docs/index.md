Let me start with a bit of history. 

Hundreds of thousands of years ago, people have already been impacting wild animals and plants. Species dying off is not a recent phenomenon. And our capacity to change landscapes and animal populations have been made so easy with technology such as fire.

Itâ€™s no coincidence that large animals have gone extinct the moment modern humans have intruded into their territory. Humans have been impacting the earth ever since.
